# NLP Web-Based Data Application

This project is a job hunting website developed using the Python Flask web development framework. It offers a seamless experience for both job hunters and employers, leveraging machine learning techniques to enhance job advertisement categorisation and searchability.

## Background

The primary aim of this project is to streamline the job hunting process by providing an intuitive platform for job seekers and employers alike. By utilising the FastText machine learning model, the application automates the categorisation of job advertisements, reducing human error and ensuring that job listings reach the most relevant audience.

## Functionality for Job Hunters

### Job Display
* The homepage features a list view of job advertisement previews, with full descriptions accessible upon clicking.
* Job advertisements are categorised, allowing users to browse listings based on their interests.
* Clicking on a category displays a list view of job previews within that category, with full descriptions accessible as well.
* Two suggested job ads per category are displayed on the homepage, providing users with quick access to relevant opportunities.
* Four ads are displayed on every category page, sorted alphabetically according to their titles.

### Create a New Job Listing
* Employers have the ability to create new job listings with ease.
* Various details such as title, description, and salary can be entered.
* The application utilises machine learning to recommend categories based on the entered information.
* Employers have the option to override suggested categories if needed.
* Upon confirmation, the created job advertisement is added to the database and can be accessed via a URL or search.
* By combining intuitive user interfaces with advanced machine learning capabilities, this NLP web-based data application revolutionises the job hunting experience, making it more efficient and effective for all users.
